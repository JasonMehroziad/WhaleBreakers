P .Awaiting a new transmission, you read your favorite book
A1.Harry Potter
A2.20,000 Leagues Under the Sea
A3.Moby Dick

Q .You receive a distress call for the capital the reads:
A1.Send Submarines
A2.Send Subway
They are overrun by whales, disguised as giant, overweight dolphins with death lasers attached to their heads
Humans press the attack with bellies full, a great deterrent since they moved slower, were larger targets, and were outgunned

Q .Humans suspect another attack and request for a   
A1.Rendezvous at 19, 00
A2.Rendezvous at 69, 420
Humans gather at 19, 00, and do literally nothing, wishing they went to 69, 420 after hearing of the legendary party that always occurs there
Humans all gather at coordinates 69, 420 and join the ongoing dance party and get high while, off in the distance, the battle rages on. The whales begin to recapture land from the humans as they notice their frontal force begin to thin

P .At the end of the day, with an intense battle raging on, a battle you can see out your window at the edge of the horizon, your co-worker approaches you and, seeing the terror in your eyes, asks about the vacation you went to with your family over the weekend in an attempt to distract you.  As you try to recall, you remember you wentÅE.
A1.Camping
A2.To the beach
A3.Snorkeling

Q .0327 and a piercing alarm sounds.  Youíre receiving a distress signal from the defending squadron on the outer edge of the front.  Theyíre requesting aid because a 
A1.Third Pod spotted.
A2.Tide pods consumed
Sergeants panic as they wonder where the whales are receiving their reinforcements.  
The General is furious and wonder why their troops are trying to eat laundry detergent. Many soldiers become incapacitated and some even die out of their stupidity

Q .Almost at the same time, you hear a message from an advanced team, deep within the whale lines.  They have reached their destination and have found
A1.Whale leader 0600
A2.Waste time until 0600 tomorrow
The sergeants hear the good news and, desperate to slow the whale onslaught, insist that they engage immediately
You reply to the squadrons attack request and ask them what their plans are until then. You hear a reply full of muttering, censored out words, and some curses that arenít censored, because if all the curses were censored, their reply would have been one long beep

Q .All the human militant leaders needed the good news, when you saw a new blinking light, signaling a new transmission incoming
A1.Whale leader assassinated
A2.Whale leader job procrastinated
The human army rejoices over this perceived massive victory, only to come to the realization that the whales would immediately choose their leader by order of succession, so literally nothing was gained
In complete fury, the militant leaders question why their orders to engage have been delayed, and yell at Frank that it better not be because he wanted to watch the water polo game, even if his favorite team was playing

P .You decide that the best food to eat is
A1.Steak
A2.Fish Tacos
A3.Sushi

Q .After a delicious, yet very nerve racking meal, you return to your station to hear the end of a message requesting to:
A1.Send mush
A2.Send fish
Without a new influx of supplies, the whale attack is noticeably stalled as as their energy and supplies quickly dwindle
The whales, with new invigorated power, launch themselves into a massive assault, closing in on the capital and preparing for a blockade

Q .The whales with continue onward to rain fire and destruction on a prison encampment. 
A1.Prison camp liberated
A2.Prison camp stands
Whales go back home victorious and ecstatic to see, once again, their imprisoned friends. 
With a tough loss, the whales lick their wounds and continue back home. Their imprisoned friends are in despair that the siege did not work out. 

Q .As you browse the other whale channels, you hear some soldiers in an attempt to lighten the mood of the war, hosting a
A1.Dance party north base
A2.Bar fight north base
Annoyed that he had to leave his post, the General goes to the northern baseÅE.only to find a massive rave. Furious that he had to swim here, expecting to see several bloodied people after a fight, and actually finding an entire battalion of people wasting their time and ignoring their duties, the General starts to grill the soldiers one by one until one of the soldiers rebels against the general and ... Nervous that you might get caught as the snitch, you change the channel
Thoroughly peeved that all the soldiers are having fun while you sit there relaying their message, you convince one of the Generals that a bar fight is occurring and he was needed to resolve and break up the fight

Q .Despite this massive rave, soldiers morale is still very low.  You can hear platoon commanders crying for help, fearing their own safety and the safety of their men, reporting that 
A1.Soldier morale low
A2.Soldierís chorale slow
The president was relayed this message, and he concluded that the best way to boost morale was to build a wall, the biggest wall, to ensure the safety of the soldiers, their families, and have a backup plan for the advancing whale horde
The militant leaders are confused why the soldiers decided to harmonize in choir, or when the learned to sing at all, and why they sang so slowly. They decide to disregard the soldiers apparent need for distraction from the war

Q .From a distant scouting platoon, you are told that 
A1.Whales moving east
A2.No whale movement
Excited to hear some reliable news, human generals order their forces to begin moving east in anticipation for an attack
Human president distributes troops towards the fronts as necessary

Q .The human army decides the best way to repel any attack from the whales would be to 
A1.Place a minefield
A2.Play mine craft
The human army anticipate an attack on New York and place an elaborate minefield, hoping to deter any future attack
The generals consider this an order from the president and intensely play minecraft, determined that there must be a learning experience or military strategy to be gained from the game 

P .Finally at the vending machine, you clumsily shove your 3 shells into the vending machine and get a 
A1.Coke
A2.Green Tea
A3.Gatorade

Q .The next morning, you see a note on your desk that reads
A1.Human leader raptured
A2.Human leader captured
All the generals and commanders salute their leader and say farewell as they knew this day would come.  They pay their respects and go in search for a new leader
The Generals all agree to nominate a temporary leader as they send out search parties to find information about their captured leader.

Q .After all this chaos, confusion, and frantic orders being thrown around, you receive near inaudible message saying
A1.Slim shady eminem
A2.Shrimp shortage imminent
Confident that this is a morale booster despite the massive blow, the generals announce to their troops that there will be an eminem concert for them soon. You can hear their cheers from the base without the transmitter
The cries for supplies slowly begin to die down as the whales begin to look less skeletal and more wholesome after their new shipment of supplies

Q .After coming to a decision that the whale human war has mostly been a war of attrition, the 
A1.Whale laundromat has decided to talk
A2.whale diplomat has decided to talk
Everyone freaks out as they wonder how the laundromat talks, and why whales need a laundromat, and when they wear clothes, and how said clothes get dirty at all, or dry
Out of hostility for their lost leader, the militant leaders unite and agree to never settle with the whales, especially after all the casualties inflicted upon them. They vow the fight until their last breath and, if they canít win, to take down as many whales as possible

P .Trying to remember what life was like before all this chaos, before the world became submerged, before the whale attacks, and hoping for the best, you begin to plan your future, when this conflict is resolved, when the war has run its toll, and decide that to 
A1.Move back home
A2.Travel the Seas
A3.Stay in your new home underwater

Q .Jumping you out of your dream, you hear the shrill cackling of the dolphins.  You can hear their cynical shrieks, laughing at your every plan.  But not this time; your recieve a transmission stating
A1.Dolphins requesting aid
A2.Dolphins resist aid
Despite your hatred towards the dolphins, you agree to pass on their message. Human leaders send fish and laser cannons to arm the dolphins to defend from possible whale attacks. Dolphins continue to cackle in their maniacal way
Out of spite for all the horrors the dolphins put you through, you mutate the transmission to demonize those pesky dolphins. Human militant leaders are convinced that the dolphins are not friends, but are helping the enemy

P .Fearing the worst, you decide to rewatch your favorite movie you have on hand to distract you from reality
A1.Die hard
A2.The Little Mermaid
A3.Finding Nemo

Q .Right in the middle of your movie, you hear a distress transmission "Whales attacking north"
A1.Whales attacking north
A2.Whales attacking south
Despite this interruption, you follow your job to carry on the message and send reinforcements to the north
Annoyed at all the soldiers who disturbed your movie you decide they didnít deserve any support. You diverted the attention of the troops to the opposite flank of where they are needed

Q .As the whale attack persists, you receive a signal from the front lines saying "Troops sustaining massive casualties"
A1.Troops sustaining massive casualties
A2.Whales sustaining massive casualties
In a scare, militant leaders divert as many troops as possible to the front lines. Troops rush to the front lines in the support of their comrades and in the defense of their capital
The militant leaders rejoice at the sound of this news, thinking that they beat the odds and have come victorious from the war
