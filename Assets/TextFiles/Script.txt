Global warming has flooded the Earth
Humans have developed underwater civilizations
Whales and humans have been waging war with each other for years due to all the destruction the humans have caused the whales in the past
You are based in a neutral transmission tower that receives messages from both other humans and whales
transmission tower is used to amplify messages
Whale calls travel most effectively through water
Messages always goes to intended recipients
Whale messages goes to whales, human messages go to humans
Communication tower in a cave waving swedish flag
Humans and whales fighting over underwater territory
Whales are winning

When suddenly, you get news that the human capital is under siege.

Humans had to retreat back from their outer posts and regroup
As the humans fight desperately to hold onto their city, they begin losing men and are forced to fall back.  Whales begin to approach the city when suddenly, a fleet of shark painted subs appear, crashing down into the water as they fell from stork shaped transport planes
A fleet of submarines come to push back the dolphin disguised whales and help to defend Atlantis
Human leaders are frantic to keep this lead, so they watch out for any weaknesses in their ranks

The human army is continued to be barraged by whale forces as death lasers can be seen flying every which direction

and your whole family had a great time, except your wife, she came down with the flu and everyone quarantined her so it doesn’t spread.

The whales, with overwhelming numbers breach the barricade made by the humans as they rush towards the capital’s second layer of defense in full force

What follows a long silence as the undercover squad engaged on their target
It was a long few hours as everyone waited in anticipation, unsure of the outcome.

In a panic, to try and devise a plan to reduce the onslaught of the whales, the human leaders all enter their little cubicles and think of a plan, essentially ending all radio chatter
After a long period of silence, you decide to take a lunch break with your coworker, and given that this may be one of your last meals,

You hear large amounts of excited screaming, dancing, EDM, and some massive bass drops, as you hear more and more soldiers conglomerate there…...as you sit, behind your desk, waiting for more telegrams

The fear of the impending attack goaded the soldiers to be on higher alert, to make sure that no detail was left unnoticed

Completely parched after a rather long day at work with several telegrams that required relaying, you rush over to the vending machine down the narrow corridor you hate.  As you run down, you swear you can hear dolphins.  Oh those filthy dolphins, always ruining your plans.  You hear their sadistic chirps, as if waiting for you, waiting for you to make a mistake.

You race back down the corridor, trying to ignore the emonic dolphin whistles as you pass, and into your office, expecting to hear another transmission, all for naught
You sit, and wait, for something, anything, to do but the rest of the day proceeds uneventfully.  

Is the best thing to do with your family

You can see in the distance the battle waging on from the defenders of the north and the massive, seemingly indomitable whale force
